heres how you update stuff on the polarfire kit

the hss 
* this thing can be done in two ways, either get the job file which will flash both the golden image and the hss onto the envm or 
https://github.com/polarfire-soc/hart-software-services/releases

This process is useful if you've already programmed your FPGA bitstream and just want to update the HSS bootloader.

    Get Your HSS: First, have your hss-envm.hex file ready (either from building it in SoftConsole or downloading it from the GitHub releases).

    Open Your Libero Project: Open the Libero project associated with your design.

    Add the HSS as an eNVM Client:

        In the "Design Flow" pane, double-click "Configure Design Initialization Data and Memories."

        Go to the "eNVM" tab.

        Click "Add...", select your hss-envm.hex file, and set the "Client Type" to "User Data."

        Click OK and save.

    Export the eNVM-Only Job:

        In the "Design Flow" pane, find and run "Export FlashPro Express Job."

        This will create a .job file in your project's \programmer directory. Because you've added an eNVM client, this .job file now contains the HSS data and the instructions to program it.

    Program with FlashPro Express:

        Now, you can open the standalone FlashPro Express software.

        Click "New Project" (or "Load Project").

        For the "Programming job file," select the .job file you just exported from Libero.

        Click RUN.

This will program only the eNVM with your new HSS and will not affect the FPGA fabric at all.
